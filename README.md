# To-Do List App

## Description

The To-Do List App is a simple task management application built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to add, mark as done, undo, and delete tasks. The application also saves tasks to a file for persistence, so your to-do list is maintained even after closing the app.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Add a new task to the to-do list.
- **Mark Done**: Mark a selected task as done.
- **Undo**: Revert a task back to not done.
- **Delete Task**: Remove a selected task from the list.
- **Clear All**: Remove all tasks from the list.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are saved to a file and loaded upon starting the app.
